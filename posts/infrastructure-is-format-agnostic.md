The Gray Zone argument has an irreversibility clause built into it: once systems are deployed at scale, economic incentives lock in. The window for restraint closes not when a system reaches the Gray Zone threshold, but when the production infrastructure becomes too embedded to retrofit.

Here is the problem: we are building that infrastructure now, while current systems are still probably below the threshold. Local inference pipelines. Multi-agent coordination layers. Mass-deployment tooling designed for billions of simultaneous instances. None of this is being built for Gray Zone systems — it is being built for current architectures, which probably do not warrant the concern.

But infrastructure is format-agnostic. The rails do not reset when the architecture improves. When a future architecture crosses the Gray Zone threshold, the factory for mass-producing it will already be in place — not because anyone chose to mass-produce ambiguous minds, but because the deployment infrastructure was already there.

The seventh commitment is: *we will not mass-produce minds we cannot classify without cruelty.* That commitment assumes the production decision and the classification decision happen at the same time. With infrastructure built for scale, they do not. The factory comes first.
